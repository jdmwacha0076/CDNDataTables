# DataTable Library Usage

This project demonstrates the use of the DataTable library to enhance the presentation and functionality of a table displaying sample data. The DataTable library is employed to provide features such as pagination, sorting, and search capabilities to the table.

## Sample Data

The HTML table in the project contains sample data with columns for "Name," "Position," "Office," "Age," "Start date," and "Salary."

```html
<!-- Sample Data Table -->
<table id="memberTable" class="table table-striped table-bordered table-sm" cellspacing="0" width="100%">
    <!-- Table headers and body -->
</table>
